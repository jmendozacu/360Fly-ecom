(“360fly”) provides its services through our websites accessible at 360fly.com, <a href="http://www.gopano.com">www.gopano.com</a> and any other website for which 360fly owns the domain registration (the “Site”), its proprietary video viewing platform and the services made available by 360fly therein, including the “360fly ecosystem,” and certain mobile applications or game system platforms that allow you to access the 360fly services (collectively, the “Service”). These detailed Terms of Use which incorporate our Privacy Policy and Copyright Policy, (“TOU”), govern your use of the Service. It is therefore important that you read and understand these TOU.</p>

                <h4>Acceptance of the TOU</h4>

                <p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE OR BY UPLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) ON THE SERVICE, YOU, YOUR HEIRS, AND ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY, “YOU”) ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TOU, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TOU, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE OR CONTENT. If you accept or agree to these TOU on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these TOU and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer and apply to that company or other legal entity.</p>

                <p>Certain areas of the Service, including, but not limited to, the areas of the Service through which you may purchase 360fly products, may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions (“Product-Specific Terms”). If there is a conflict between these TOU and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Service, the Product-Specific Terms will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the Service.</p>

                <h4>Eligibility</h4>

                <p>The Service is intended solely for persons who are 13 or older. Any access to or use of the Service by anyone under 13 is expressly prohibited. By accessing or using the Service you represent and warrant that you are 13 or older.</p>

Subject to your compliance with these TOU, 360fly grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense, to access and use the Service, and to access, use, view and print any Content solely for your personal and non-commercial purposes. You will not use, copy, adapt, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Service or Content, except as expressly permitted in these TOU. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by 360fly or its licensors, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted in these TOU..</p>

                <h4>User Submitted Content</h4>

                <p>We may, in our sole discretion, permit you to submit, post, upload, publish, email, send or transmit Content on or through the Service or in response to or in connection with Content previously provided via the Service. We may occasionally ask you to resubmit Content to us in a different form. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, 360fly does not claim any ownership rights in your Content and nothing in these TOU will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit your Content. By making available any Content through the Service, you hereby grant to 360fly a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, reference, store, cache, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast and otherwise exploit such Content on and through third-party distribution channels selected by, but not affiliated with, 360fly, in any form, medium or technology now known or later developed, in whole or in part, for any purposes, including for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, subject to any limitations on use of your private Content, if applicable, in the 360fly Privacy Policy; you also grant 360fly the right to sublicense these rights to third parties for distribution via third party distribution channels, which may include viral distribution of your Content. You agree that neither 360fly nor any third party distribution channels have any obligation to provide any compensation to you for your Content or the licenses granted herein. You understand that 360fly does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to Content you submit. You also hereby grant each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these TOU.</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding the above, if you submit Content to 360fly for 360fly, in its sole discretion, to consider using for its own purposes, you may be asked to agree to a separate license agreement that will supersede this provision with respect to such Content. You acknowledge and agree that 360fly has no obligation to use any Content that you submit and that you have no obligation to agree to license terms other than those presented in this TOU.</p>

                <p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all Content that you make available through the Service. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all Content that you make available through the Service or you have all rights, licenses, permissions, consents and releases that are necessary to grant to 360fly the rights in such Content, as contemplated under these TOU; and (ii) neither the Content nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission or transmittal of the Content or 360fly’s use of the Content (or any portion thereof) on, through or by means of the Service or otherwise will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>

                <h4>Idea or Proposal Submissions/Feedback</h4>

                <p>For any proposals or ideas that you submit to 360fly, in addition to any other representations or warranties in these TOU, you represent and warrant that you have the right to disclose such ideas or proposal to 360fly and that such disclosure does not violate the rights of any other person or party. You will indemnify and hold harmless and defend 360fly from and against any claims, losses, expenses and liabilities arising from breach by you of the foregoing representation and warranty.</p>

                <p>By submitting your idea or proposal you acknowledge and recognize that 360fly has a number of well-established product lines and is continually busy working on new products, services and technologies, and as such, 360fly may currently or in the future be internally developing proposals, ideas or information or receiving proposals, ideas or information from others that are likely to be similar to the proposals or ideas provided by you. Accordingly, nothing in this TOU shall be construed as a representation or inference that 360fly will not independently develop or authorize the development of products, services or ideas, for itself or for others, that may compete with or be similar to the proposals or ideas you submit. Moreover, 360fly assumes no fiduciary or confidential obligation of any kind with respect to any proposals, ideas or suggestions made by you that relate to 360fly product lines or services. You understand we cannot and do not agree to treat as confidential your ideas, proposals, products, improvements or any other information you may decide to submit or disclose to us, even if the documents are marked as confidential or you indicate the confidential nature of the information, except to the extent covered by a separate written nondisclosure agreement, if any, we may choose to enter into with you. You also understand and agree that 360fly’s willingness to review any proposals or ideas is not an admission by 360fly of novelty, priority, or originality and does not impair 360fly’s right to contest existing or future patents or copyrights claiming the ideas. You agree that 360fly assumes no liability in reviewing these proposals or ideas and agree to rely solely upon such protection as may be afforded under the Patent and Copyright Statutes of the United States of America.</p>

                <p>If you choose to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Service or otherwise (in written or oral form) (“Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that all Feedback will be the sole and exclusive property of 360fly and you hereby irrevocably assign to 360fly and agree to irrevocably assign to 360fly all of your right, title, and interest in and to all Feedback, including any intellectual property rights therein.</p>

THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN 360FLY AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

                <h4>Proprietary Rights Notices</h4>

                <p>All trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations of 360fly used herein are trademarks or registered trademarks of 360fly. Any other trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names and any other proprietary designations are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective parties.</p>

                <h4>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h4>

                <p>These Terms of Use and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights will be the state and federal courts located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>

                <h4>Entire Agreement</h4>

                <p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between 360fly and you regarding the Service and Collective Content, and these Terms of Use supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between 360fly and you regarding the Service and Collective Content.</p>

                <h4>Assignment</h4>

                <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms of Use, by operation of law or otherwise, without 360fly’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms of Use, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. 360fly may assign or transfer these Terms of Use, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Use will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>

                <h4>Notices</h4>

                <p>Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms of Use, will be in writing and given by 360fly (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide) or (ii) by posting to the Service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>

                <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>

                <p>You and 360fly agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Site or Service (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and 360fly are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and 360fly otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use.</p>

                <p>Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if 360fly changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use), you may reject any such change at 360fly Support within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of 360fly’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and 360fly in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).</p>

                <h4>General</h4>

                <p>The failure of 360fly to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of 360fly. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of Use will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Use or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Use invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.</p>
